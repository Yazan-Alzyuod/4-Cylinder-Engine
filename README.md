# 4-Cylinder-Engine
# 4-Cylinder Engine Assembly (SolidWorks)


## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains the 3D CAD models and assembly for a complete 4-cylinder internal combustion engine designed using *SolidWorks*. The project demonstrates a detailed mechanical design workflow from individual component modeling to full system assembly, with a focus on automotive engineering principles.

The engine features a four-stroke cycle configuration with precise piston-crankshaft relationships, designed to showcase proper mechanical interactions between critical engine components. This project serves as both an educational resource and a demonstration of advanced CAD modeling techniques.
